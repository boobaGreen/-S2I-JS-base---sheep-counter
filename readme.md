Project realized for the [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/) "Javascript Basics" course.

You can change the value by pressing "-" and "+" buttons and reset the value with the "reset" button.

Idea:

I noticed that the counter is a classic basic exercise in Javascript courses, you can find dozens of examples everywhere, I wanted to do something original and thinking about a counter .... the thing that immediately jumped into my mind was counting sheep, like I did as a child when I wanted to fall asleep

Technical path:

In this case I also had to deepen the concept of Canvas which I still wanted to study and even if it is a very vast and powerful topic if studied in depth in every aspect, now I think I'm starting to understand something.

The starry sky is not an image but it is procedurally generated in javascript with the "draw_sky" file , this makes each use of the counter a somewhat unique experience and I really like this aspect of the project.

The sheep is a canvas, and the ground together with the obstacle is another canvas.

I also wanted to add some sounds, which initially as you can see from the provisional version were different, then with the input of the Star2Impact community I transformed it in a more sympathetic way.
When the sheep moves forward there is a sound reminiscent of a jump, for reset a sheep bleat, and for backward movement a sound reminiscent of old tape winding (rew)

The choice of font was important and sought after because it was part of the design in a decisive way. I am very happy with what I found, I think it fits very well with the project as a whole.

The design of the buttons and the lighting of the base plate are totally original and made after various less fortunate attempts, but in this process as in the others of the project I am happy to have created something original and totally autonomously, following a precise idea but also letting myself be guided by inspiration and attempts, let's say I followed a standard that I had in mind but I didn't hold back in experimenting with some variations on the theme, a bit like in jazz.

The design of the project has gone through many intermediate stages, one of the latest stages of progress is for example this: [Provisional version](https://boobagreen.github.io/Counter/)
